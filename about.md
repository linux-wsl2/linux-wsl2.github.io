## About

Linux-WSL2 is a project started by [@rmnscnce](https://www.github.com/rmnscnce) to bring the latest upstream Linux kernel for WSL2 with little to no modifications. The kernel included in standard WSL2 environment â€” while stable, is not the latest, even in its `longterm` variant. Using Linux-WSL2 upstream kernel is a great way to get the newest experience brought by Linux to your WSL2 environments
